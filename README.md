# Build your website in 3 steps

There are a few different ways to build a website using Beautiful Jekyll, and this document will go through the simplest one: using a fork on GitHub. For most people (including myself!), this easy method is the recommended one.

Even if you choose to use one of the [advanced installation methods](https://beautifuljekyll.com/getstarted/#install-steps-hard), I still suggest you read through the easy method first.

## The easy way (recommended!)

Getting started is *literally* as easy as 1-2-3 :smile:

Scroll down to see the steps involved, but here is a 30-second video just as a reference as you work through the steps. If you don't already have a [GitHub account](https://github.com), you'll need to sign up.

![Installation steps](https://beautifuljekyll.com/assets/img/install-steps.gif)

### 1. Fork this project

Click on the __*Fork*__ button at the top right corner of this page. Forking means that you're copying this entire project and all its files into your account. Do not click on the __*Create fork*__ button on the next page yet.

### 2. Rename the repository to `YOURUSERNAME.github.io`

You'll see the word "repository" used a lot in GitHub - it simply means "project". Under __*Repository name*__ you should see the name `beautiful-jekyll`, this is where you need to rename your project to `YOURUSERNAME.github.io` (replace `YOURUSERNAME` with your GitHub user name). It's important to use this exact name so that GitHub will recognize it and automatically create a website for this project.   

> Tip: If you want to use a different URL for your website, check out the [FAQ](https://beautifuljekyll.com/faq/#custom-domain)
 
### 3. Customize your website settings

Edit the `_config.yml` file to change any settings you want. To edit the file, first click on it to view the file, and on the next page click on the pencil icon to edit it (watch the video tutorial above if you're confused).  The settings in the file are self-explanatory and there are comments inside the file to help you understand what each setting does. Any line that begins with a hashtag (`#`) is a comment, and the other lines are actual settings. After changing the settings, click the green __*Commit changes*__ button to save these edits.

> Note: In the video above, only one setting in the `_config.yml` file is edited, but you should go through the rest of the settings as well.

### 4. Congratulations! You have a website!

If you named your project correctly and made an edit to the config file, your website should be ready in a minute or two at `https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io`. Every time you make a change to any file, your website will get rebuilt and should be updated in about a minute or so. Your website will be initialized with several sample blog posts and a couple other pages.

## The harder way (for advanced users)

The instructions above explain how to use Beautiful Jekyll in the easiest way: by forking on GitHub. There are more [advanced installation methods](https://beautifuljekyll.com/getstarted/#install-steps-hard) that include either using GitHub Pages with remote themes, or using Ruby gems. They provide you with more control, but are only intended for advanced users.

> Note: Beautiful Jekyll was primarily designed to be used as a GitHub theme, so you will not get any support if you use this theme via Ruby gems. 

# Plans

Beautiful Jekyll is, and always will be, free. But if you want to remove the Beautiful Jekyll ad from your website, use a Dark Mode skin, access office hours, or simply support the development efforts, [check out the different plans](https://beautifuljekyll.com/plans).

# Add your own content

To add pages to your site, you can either write a markdown file (`.md`) or you can write an HTML file. It's much easier to write markdown than HTML, so that's the recommended approach ([here's a great tutorial](https://markdowntutorial.com/) if you need to learn markdown in 5 minutes).

To see an example of a markdown file, click on any file that ends in `.md`, for example [`aboutme.md`](./aboutme.md). On that page you can see some nicely formatted text (there's a word in bold, a link, a few bullet points), and if you click on the pencil icon to edit the file, you'll see the markdown code that generated the pretty text. Very easy! 

In contrast, look at [`tags.html`](./tags.html). That's how your write HTML - not as pretty. So stick with markdown if you don't know HTML.

Any markdown or HTML file that you create will be available on your website under `https://<yourusername>.github.io/<pagename>`. For example, if you create a file `about.md` (or `about.html`) then it'll exist at `https://<yourusername>.github.io/about`.

Files you create inside the [`_posts`](./_posts) directory will be treated as blog entries. You can look at the existing files there to get an idea of how to write blog posts. Note the format of the blog post files - they must follow the naming convention of `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md`. After you successfully add your own post, you can delete the existing files inside [`_posts`](./_posts) to remove the sample posts, as those are just demo posts to help you learn.

# Customizing parameters for each page

**One last important thing**: In order to have your new pages use this template and not just be plain HTML pages, **you must add [YAML front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) to the top of each page**:


```
---
---
```

This is where you'll be able to give each page some extra parameters (such as a title, a subtitle, an image, etc - [below is a list of all parameters](#supported-parameters)). Add any parameters you want between these two dashed lines, for example:

```
---
title: Contact me
subtitle: Here you'll find all the ways to get in touch with me
---
```

If you don't want to use any parameters on a page, you still need to use the two dashed lines. If you don't, then your file will be shown as-is without the Beautiful Jekyll template.

You can look at the top of [`aboutme.md`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll/master/aboutme.md) as an example.

**Important takeaway: ALWAYS add the YAML front matter, which is two lines of three dashes, to EVERY page. If you have any parameters, they go between the two lines.**

# Supported parameters

Below is a list of the parameters that Beautiful Jekyll supports (any of these can be added to the YAML front matter of any page). Remember to also look in the `_config.yml` file to see additional site-wide settings. If there's a parameter that you want to apply to the entire site instead of one specific page, check out [this FAQ answer](https://beautifuljekyll.com/faq/#default-params).

## Main parameters

These are the basic YAML parameters that you are most likely to use on most pages.

Parameter   | Description
----------- | -----------
title       | Page or blog post title
subtitle    | Short description of page or blog post that goes under the title
tags        | List of tags to categorize the post. Separate the tags with commas and place them inside square brackets. Example: `[personal, analysis, finance]`
cover-img   | Include a large full-width image at the top of the page. You can either provide the path to a single image (eg. `"/path/to/img"`) , or a list of images to cycle through (eg. `["/path/img1", "/path/img2"]`). If you want to add a caption to an image, then you must use the list notation (use `[]` even if you have only one image), and each image should be provided as `"/path/to/img" : "Caption of image"`.
thumbnail-img | For blog posts, if you want to add a thumbnail that will show up in the feed, use `thumbnail-img: /path/to/image`. If no thumbnail is provided, then `cover-img` will be used as the thumbnail. You can use `thumbnail-img: ""` to disable a thumbnail.
comments    | If you want do add comments to a specific page, use `comments: true`. Comments only work if you enable one of the comments providers (Facebook, disqus, staticman, utterances, giscus, CommentBox) in `_config.yml` file. Comments are automatically enabled on blog posts but not on other pages; to turn comments off for a specific post, use `comments: false`.
mathjax     | If you want to use LaTeX formulas, you need to enable MathJax. Note that in MathJax you need to use `$$` and `\\(` to start and end expressions

## Parameters for SEO and social media sharing

These parameters let you control what information shows up when a page is shown in a search engine (such as Google) or gets shared on social media (such as Twitter/Facebook).

Parameter   | Description
----------- | -----------
share-title | A title for the page. If not provided, then `title` will be used, and if that's missing then the site title (from `_config.yml`) is used.
share-description | A brief description of the page. If not provided, then `subtitle` will be used, and if that's missing then an excerpt from the page content is used.
share-img   | The image to show. If not provided, then `cover-img` or `thumbnail-img` will be used if one of them is provided.

## Less commonly used parameters

These are parameters that you may not use often, but can come in handy sometimes.

Parameter   | Description
----------- | -----------
author      | Specify the author of a blog post (useful if a website has multiple authors).
readtime    | If you want a post to show how many minutes it will take to read it, use `readtime: true`.
show-avatar | If you have an avatar configured in the `_config.yml` but you want to turn it off on a specific page, use `show-avatar: false`.
social-share | By default, every blog post has buttons to share the page on social media. If you want to turn this feature off, use `social-share: false`.
nav-short   | By default, the navigation bar gets shorter after scrolling down the page. If you want the navigation bar to always be short on a certain page, use `nav-short: true`
gh-repo   | If you want to show GitHub buttons at the top of a post, this sets the GitHub repo name (eg. `daattali/beautiful-jekyll`). You must also use the `gh-badge` parameter to specify what buttons to show.
gh-badge  | Select which GitHub buttons to display. Available options are: [star, watch, fork, follow]. You must also use the `gh-repo` parameter to specify the GitHub repo.
last-updated | If you want to show that a blog post was updated after it was originally released, you can specify an "Updated on" date.
layout      | What type of page this is (default is `post` for blog posts and `page` for other pages). See _Page types_ section below for more information.

## Advanced parameters

These are advanced parameters that are only useful for people who need very fine control over their website.

Parameter   | Description
----------- | -----------
footer-extra | If you want to include extra content below the social media icons in the footer, create an HTML file in the `_includes/` folder (for example `_includes/myinfo.html`) and set `footer-extra` to the name of the file (for example `footer-extra: myinfo.html`). Accepts a single file or a list of files.
before-content | Similar to `footer-extra`, but used for including HTML before the main content of the page (below the title).
after-content | Similar to `footer-extra`, but used for including HTML after the main content of the page (above the footer).
head-extra   | Similar to `footer-extra`, but used if you have any HTML code that needs to be included in the `<head>` tag of the page.
language    | HTML language code to be set on the page's &lt;html&gt; element.
full-width  | By default, page content is constrained to a standard width. Use `full-width: true` to allow the content to span the entire width of the window.
js          | List of local JavaScript files to include in the page (eg. `/assets/js/mypage.js`)
ext-js      | List of external JavaScript files to include in the page (eg. `//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/underscore.js/1.8.2/underscore-min.js`). External JavaScript files that support [Subresource Integrity (SRI)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity) can be specified using the `href` and `sri` parameters eg.<br/>`href: "//code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.min.js"`<br/>`sri: "sha256-hVVnYaiADRTO2PzUGmuLJr8BLUSjGIZsDYGmIJLv2b8="`
css         | List of local CSS files to include in the page
ext-css      | List of external CSS files to include in the page. External CSS files using SRI (see `ext-js` parameter) are also supported.

## Page types

- **post** - To write a blog post, add a markdown or HTML file in the `_posts` folder. As long as you give it YAML front matter (the two lines of three dashes), it will automatically be rendered like a blog post. Look at the existing blog post files to see examples of how to use YAML parameters in blog posts.
- **page** - Any page outside the `_posts` folder that uses YAML front matter will have a very similar style to blog posts.
- **home** - The home layout is meant to act as the homepage of your blog posts - it will display all your blog posts, sorted from newest to oldest. A file using the `home` layout must be named `index.html` (not `index.md` or anything else!).
- **minimal** - If you want to create a page with minimal styling (ie. without the bulky navigation bar and footer), assign `layout: minimal` to the YAML front matter.
- If you want to completely bypass the template engine and just write your own HTML page, simply omit the YAML front matter. Only do this if you know how to write HTML!

An abstract class vs interface‚Äîinto a recharge app scenario.

Scenario: Recharge App
Your app supports multiple Recharge Providers (like Airtel, Vodafone, etc.). Every provider:

Has a provider name.

Can perform a recharge operation.

Has a method to validate the recharge amount (rules may vary).

Using an Abstract Class in C#
// Abstract base class with common fields and methods
public abstract class RechargeProvider
{
    public string ProviderName { get; private set; }

    public RechargeProvider(string providerName)
    {
        ProviderName = providerName;
    }

    // Common method shared by all providers
    public void LogTransaction(decimal amount)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Transaction logged for {ProviderName} with amount: {amount}");
    }

    // Abstract methods to be implemented by each provider
    public abstract bool ValidateAmount(decimal amount);
    public abstract void Recharge(decimal amount);
}

// Airtel provider
public class AirtelProvider : RechargeProvider
{
    public AirtelProvider() : base("Airtel") {}

    public override bool ValidateAmount(decimal amount)
    {
        // Airtel only allows recharges between 10 and 1000
        return amount >= 10 && amount <= 1000;
    }

    public override void Recharge(decimal amount)
    {
        if (!ValidateAmount(amount))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Invalid amount for Airtel recharge.");
            return;
        }
        Console.WriteLine($"Recharging {amount} to Airtel.");
        LogTransaction(amount);
    }
}

// Vodafone provider
public class VodafoneProvider : RechargeProvider
{
    public VodafoneProvider() : base("Vodafone") {}

    public override bool ValidateAmount(decimal amount)
    {
        // Vodafone allows recharge from 20 to 1500
        return amount >= 20 && amount <= 1500;
    }

    public override void Recharge(decimal amount)
    {
        if (!ValidateAmount(amount))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Invalid amount for Vodafone recharge.");
            return;
        }
        Console.WriteLine($"Recharging {amount} to Vodafone.");
        LogTransaction(amount);
    }
}
Using an Interface in C#

public interface IRechargeProvider
{
    string ProviderName { get; }
    bool ValidateAmount(decimal amount);
    void Recharge(decimal amount);
    void LogTransaction(decimal amount);
}

public class AirtelProvider : IRechargeProvider
{
    public string ProviderName => "Airtel";

    public bool ValidateAmount(decimal amount)
    {
        return amount >= 10 && amount <= 1000;
    }

    public void Recharge(decimal amount)
    {
        if (!ValidateAmount(amount))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Invalid amount for Airtel recharge.");
            return;
        }
        Console.WriteLine($"Recharging {amount} to Airtel.");
        LogTransaction(amount);
    }

    public void LogTransaction(decimal amount)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Transaction logged for Airtel with amount: {amount}");
    }
}

public class VodafoneProvider : IRechargeProvider
{
    public string ProviderName => "Vodafone";

    public bool ValidateAmount(decimal amount)
    {
        return amount >= 20 && amount <= 1500;
    }

    public void Recharge(decimal amount)
    {
        if (!ValidateAmount(amount))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Invalid amount for Vodafone recharge.");
            return;
        }
        Console.WriteLine($"Recharging {amount} to Vodafone.");
        LogTransaction(amount);
    }

    public void LogTransaction(decimal amount)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Transaction logged for Vodafone with amount: {amount}");
    }
}
Why Abstract Class Is Better Here:
The LogTransaction method logic is shared and written once.

The ProviderName property is maintained in one place.

You avoid repeating common code in every provider.

Each provider only focuses on its own validation and recharge logic.


**1. What is .NET Core?** <br>
.NET Core is a cross-platform, open-source framework for building modern, cloud-based, and internet-connected applications. It supports Windows, Linux, and macOS.

**2. What is the difference between IServiceCollection and IServiceProvider?** <br>
IServiceCollection is used to register services and configure dependency injection. IServiceProvider is used to resolve and provide service instances at runtime.

**3. What are the main differences between .NET Core and .NET Framework?** <br>
‚Ä¢ .NET Core is cross-platform; .NET Framework is Windows-only.
‚Ä¢ .NET Core is open-source; .NET Framework is not fully open-source.
‚Ä¢ .NET Core supports side-by-side versioning; .NET Framework does not.

**4. What is Dependency Injection in .NET Core?** <br>
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies. .NET Core has built-in support for DI via the IServiceCollection and IServiceProvider.

**5. What is Middleware in ASP.NET Core?** <br>
Middleware is software that is assembled into an application pipeline to handle requests and responses. Each middleware component can process requests, pass them to the next component, or short-circuit the pipeline.

**6. How do you configure services in .NET Core?** <br>
Services are configured in the Program.cs or Startup.cs file using the IServiceCollection interface, typically in the ConfigureServices method.

**7. What is the purpose of the appsettings.json file?** <br>
appsettings.json is used to store configuration data such as connection strings, app settings, and logging configuration. It supports hierarchical data and can be loaded into the configuration system.

**8. How do you implement logging in .NET Core?** <br>
.NET Core provides built-in logging via the ILogger<T> interface. You can log information, warnings, errors, etc., and integrate with providers like Console, Debug, Serilog, NLog, etc.

**9. What is Kestrel?** <br>
Kestrel is a cross-platform web server for ASP.NET Core applications. It is the default web server and is designed for high performance.

**10. How do you enable CORS in ASP.NET Core?** <br>
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) can be enabled by adding services with services.AddCors() and configuring policies in Configure using app.UseCors().

**11. What is Entity Framework Core?** <br>
Entity Framework Core (EF Core) is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for .NET Core. It allows developers to work with databases using .NET objects, supports LINQ queries, and handles database migrations.

**12. What are the lifetimes of services in .NET Core DI?** <br>
‚Ä¢ Singleton: One instance for the entire application.
‚Ä¢ Scoped: One instance per HTTP request.
‚Ä¢ Transient: A new instance every time the service is requested.

**13. How do you implement custom middleware in ASP.NET Core?** <br>
Create a class with an Invoke or InvokeAsync method that takes HttpContext as a parameter. Register it in the pipeline using app.UseMiddleware<YourMiddleware>().

**14. What is the purpose of the app.UseRouting() and app.UseEndpoints() methods?** <br>
app.UseRouting() enables routing capabilities.
app.UseEndpoints() defines the endpoints for the app (e.g., controllers, Razor Pages).

**15. How do you handle configuration in .NET Core?** <br>
.NET Core uses the IConfiguration interface to read configuration from various sources like appsettings.json, environment variables, and command-line arguments.

**16. What is the difference between appsettings.json and appsettings.Development.json?** <br>
appsettings.json contains default configuration.
appsettings.Development.json overrides settings for the Development environment.

**17. How do you enable HTTPS redirection in ASP.NET Core?** <br>
By calling app.UseHttpsRedirection() in the middleware pipeline.

**18. What is Model Binding in ASP.NET Core?** <br>
Model binding maps data from HTTP requests (route, query string, form, body) to action method parameters.

**19. How do you return different HTTP status codes from a controller action?** <br>
Use built-in methods like Ok(), BadRequest(), NotFound(), Created(), etc., or return an IActionResult with a specific status code.

**20. What is the purpose of IHostedService?** <br>
IHostedService is used to run background tasks in ASP.NET Core, such as consuming messages from a queue or scheduled jobs.


Here‚Äôs a clear comparison of AddScoped, AddSingleton, and AddTransient in .NET Core Dependency Injection:
---
1. AddSingleton<br>
‚Ä¢	Lifetime: Only one instance is created and shared for the entire application lifetime.<br>
‚Ä¢	When to use: For stateless services or services that maintain shared state/caches/configuration.<br>
‚Ä¢	Example:
	builder.Services.AddSingleton<IMyService, MyService>();
	
	Request 1 - Service1: 9f2a0c0b-4c92-41d7-8a11-ea7a3c8cb1f9<br>
	Request 1 - Service2: 9f2a0c0b-4c92-41d7-8a11-ea7a3c8cb1f9<br>

	Request 2 - Service2: 9f2a0c0b-4c92-41d7-8a11-ea7a3c8cb1f9<br>

	
2. AddScoped<br>
‚Ä¢	Lifetime: One instance is created per HTTP request (scope). The same instance is used throughout a single request, but a new one is created for each new request.<br>
‚Ä¢	When to use: For services that should be unique per request, such as database contexts (e.g., Entity Framework‚Äôs DbContext).<br>
‚Ä¢	Example:
	builder.Services.AddScoped<IMyService, MyService>();
	
	Request 1 - Service1: c1f105dc-b842-4b62-99a4-96c5024e4f2d<br>
	Request 1 - Service2: c1f105dc-b842-4b62-99a4-96c5024e4f2d<br>

	Request 2 - Service2: 82c764b5-d893-4cfb-ae80-ec82c5f72b12<br>

	
3. AddTransient<br>
‚Ä¢	Lifetime: A new instance is created every time the service is requested.<br>
‚Ä¢	When to use: For lightweight, stateless services or operations that do not need to maintain state between calls.<br>
‚Ä¢	Example:
	builder.Services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();
	
	Request 1 - Service1: f6b10d21-9644-4e82-b1c0-5ff47b66d9a6<br>
	Request 1 - Service2: 7383a5a2-6c77-465a-9b6b-9c89dc85e7a1<br>

	Request 2 - Service1: 3bdf2b3b-e204-4c39-b0f1-32c99f72c689<br>
	Request 2 - Service2: b1045fe2-0d55-4a69-81c5-e81aef6d4d4b<br>


| Method         | Lifetime             | Use Case Example                |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `AddSingleton` | Application-wide     | Logging, configuration, caching |
| `AddScoped`    | Per HTTP request     | Database context, unit of work  |
| `AddTransient` | Every injection/call | Utility/helper services         |

Tip:
‚Ä¢	Use AddSingleton for shared, thread-safe services.
‚Ä¢	Use AddScoped for services that should be unique per request.
‚Ä¢	Use AddTransient for lightweight, stateless, and short-lived services.	


public interface IMyService
{
    Guid GetOperationId();
}

public class MyService : IMyService
{

    }

    public Guid GetOperationId() => _operationId;
}

What is CI/CD?
‚Ä¢	Continuous Integration (CI):
Developers frequently merge code changes into a shared repository. Each merge triggers an automated build and test process, ensuring code quality and early bug detection.
‚Ä¢	Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD):
After CI, code is automatically (deployment) or manually (delivery) released to production or staging environments. This automates the release process and reduces manual errors.
---
Typical CI/CD Pipeline Steps
1.	Source Control:
Code is pushed to a repository (e.g., GitHub, Azure Repos).
2.	Build:
The application is built (e.g., using dotnet build for .NET).
3.	Test:
Automated tests are run (e.g., dotnet test).
4.	Publish/Package:
The build output is packaged for deployment.
5.	Deploy:
The package is deployed to a server, cloud, or container.
6.	Monitor:
Application health and logs are monitored post-deployment.
